🔥 Dual-Camera Thermal Imaging System

This project is a Python-based thermal imaging control system designed for simultaneous management and recording of two infrared cameras: the PI 1M and PI 640i. Built with PyQt5, the application offers an intuitive dashboard-style GUI for live camera control, ROI (Region of Interest) selection, FPS monitoring, and job file management.
🚀 Features

    🎥 Dual-Camera Streaming: Concurrent control and monitoring of PI 1M and PI 640i thermal cameras.

    🟢 Start/Stop Recording: Easily control acquisition sessions for each camera.

    📈 Live FPS Display: Real-time frame rate updates for performance tracking.

    📁 Job File Integration: Dynamically update configurations via .job files.

    ✂️ ROI Selection: Mark regions of interest for focused analysis.

    💾 Save Recordings: Persist thermal data for post-processing.
